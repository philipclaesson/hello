			<h3>What is it?</h3>
			<p>Programming Without Borders Rinkeby aims at teaching programming to kids in Rinkeby, Stockholm. Our goal is to awake the kids' interest in technology (as well as education) and showing them a possible career within tech!</p>

			<p>The workshops was started as a collaboration between Engineers Without Borders KTH, Yennenga Progress and Red Cross Sp√•nga. While I am no longer active, I am happy to see that the workshops are still running and growing. </p>

			<p>The weekly workshops was visited by 10-20 kids and 5-10 volunteers from unis and employers in Stockholm, such as KTH, Google, Tesla, Mathworks. The workshops also received funding from King. </p>
			<h3>What was my role?</h3>
			- Organizing weekly workshops <br>
			- Finding volunteers <br>
			- Tutoring<br>
